# My CTF Journey

Hi! I’m Megane, and this repo documents my journey through various CTF challenges — starting with picoCTF. I’m especially focused on learning reverse engineering, binary exploitation, cryptography, and web vulnerabilities.

Each folder is organized by challenge category. I share my thought process, tools, and scripts used — **but never the actual flags**, to respect the integrity of the challenges.

Feel free to follow along or use this as inspiration for your own learning!
