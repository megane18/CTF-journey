**Category**: Reverse Engineering  
**Points**: 100  
**Challenge Description**:  
Weâ€™re given a simple binary to reverse. It prints a message if the correct input is entered.

---

### My Thought Process

I opened the binary in Ghidra and looked at the `main` function. It compares our input with a hardcoded string using `strcmp`.

I used `strings` and `objdump` to analyze it quickly and confirmed the check value was `"secret_input"`.
